# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

There's a whole heap of changes in this one. The main changes are listed below. I'll make sure in the future to pay more attention to how changes are tracked through git in my work.

- index file with responsive rows and columns.
- responsive banner image on both index.html and Portfolio.html.
- responsive text forms on Contact.html.
- navigation bar with highlighting text depending on what page the user is on.
- portfolio page with responsive cards and images.
- reset.css to reset the default browser stylings, and a style.css to add bits of color to the pages when bootstrap could not.
